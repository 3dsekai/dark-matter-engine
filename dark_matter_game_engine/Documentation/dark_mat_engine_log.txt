The "light flicker on rotating meshes bug" is being caused by the
'normModelMat' uniform. The below vertex normal calculation is probably incorrect:

normal = normModelMat * attrNormal; //calculate the vertex normal

=================================================

So, it looks like my "light flicker" problem is being caused by my
matrix inverse algorithm churning out funky values.
Back to the drawing board...
Graphics Gems pg. 766 has a matrix inverse algo I could try using.

Finally got the matrix inverse algo working.
I scrapped the old one, and recreated it based on the
algorithm from Graphics Games.

My normals for my cube are totally wrong.
The vertex normals are supposed to be vectors, but for some reason I'm storing
them as one float per vertex (not sure why I'm doing that...).
The cube vertices should look like this:

//  pos coords         tex coords   normals
	//front
    -1.0, -1.0,  1.0,  0.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f, //bottom left
     1.0, -1.0,  1.0,  1.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f, //bottom right
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f, //top right
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  0.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f, //top left
    // top
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  0.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f,  0.0f,
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  1.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f,  0.0f,

Explanation by Madsy9 on why 8 vertices and indices can't define a cube with tex coords and normals:
https://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/4oozww/indexed_buffers_and_face_normals/

	Indices in OpenGL refer to vertices, and a vertex in OpenGL is the group of all
	the attributes to be interpolated over a primitive, in addition to a position.
	A vertex is not uniquely defined by its position or any of its attributes!
	It's quite common to have multiple vertices both share normals as well as positions.
	Again, there are no index arrays for "individual" attributes, only per vertex element.

	With that out of the way, I think this confusion often stems from beginners being
	introduced to the dreaded cube as their first 3D object to experiment with,
	which is absolutely the worst 3D primitive / polyhedron for that purpose.
	When challenged to add normals and texture coordinates to a cube, beginners gets
	really confused because they think the cube only consists of 8 vertices.
	But as I mentioned, in OpenGL a vertex is not unique based on its position.
	So when beginners feel compelled to optimize their cubes, they start looking
	for ways to keep the misconception maintained, by finding a way to separate the
	vertex attributes so they can still hold the belief that the cube has only 8 vertices.

	And sure, a cube in OpenGL does have 8 vertices if you don't have any extra
	vertex attributes. It's just that vertex data such as normals and texture coordinates
	throw a spanner in the works because suddenly, you have 3 vertices for every vertex position
	since the normals point in three different directions. Facing this new problem,
	beginners start wondering what the point with OpenGL vertex indices is, since you
	apparently can't reuse any data. That's the cube's fault for being such a difficult object.
	OpenGL indices do open for a lot of reuse as soon as your mesh consists of more
	vertices inside the boundary and with no sharp 90 degree corners.
	Same idea applies to triangle strips.

Finished the basic mesh material and light shading.
Time for a celebratory drink!

I got diffuse/specular light maps to work.

important point 1:
I think I need to revamp my texture loading process.
I'm loading, deleting, then realoading a texture everytime I apply it to
a new object - creating a new texture id every time.
I should load all textures ONCE on startup, then appropriately apply the id
to the mesh.

important point 2:
In my current setup, the shader expects two material textures - diffuse and
specular. This is fine if I've created a texture for both, but breaks down if
a mesh lacks one. I need to devise a shader algorithm that calculates a default
fragment color in the absence of a material texture.

=================================================

8/24/2019 Log

=================================================

fix 1:
I was configuring my material textures incorrectly.
the sampler2D shader uniform does NOT correspond to the texture ID.
It corresponds to the texture unit!
glActiveTexture() sets the active texture unit (GL_TEXTURE0...etc).
I set the diffuse/specular material properties to their appropriate texture units.
I created two new properties (diffTexId/specTexId) to save the texture's Id.
This Id is bound to the shader via glBindTexture.
For more on binding textures to samplers, check the
"Binding textures to samplers" section on this document:
https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Sampler_(GLSL)

fix2:
I fixed important point 1 from 8/23 by creating a texture manager,
loading all textures on startup, and fetching the texture ids from the manager
whenever I need them.

=================================================

=================================================

fix:
I fixed important point 2 from 8/23.
I created a one pixel black texture, and initialized all mesh
material textures with it. Therefore, for any objects lacking a material texture,
the missing texture will have the default RGBA: 0,0,0,0.

=================================================

=================================================

optimization:
For each instance of a mesh, I was re-initializing the mesh with opengl every
time I created a new instance. Generating a new VAO for every instance of a
mesh is unecessary. Each unique mesh needs only one VAO, and only needs to be
initialized once.
I created a mesh manager. The manager generates the VAO and binds buffer data
once for each unique mesh and saves it. Each instance of that mesh just references
that data.

After hours of futile debugging I've finally figured out why
textures weren't correctly mapping to their models.

The issue:
Textures were not correctly mapping to their coordinates for models.
The reason was in the lib_aiProcessMesh() function.
I was ordering the vertices in the following order:
1. position
2. normals
3. texture coords
4. tangent
5. bitangent

My shader orders vertex attributes in the following order:
1. position
2. texture coords
3. normals

In other words, the ordering of tex coords and normals in the model process
mesh method was reversed.

Solution:
The solution was simple. Just insert texture coords into the vertex before
the normals.

Lesson:
The ordering of vertex attributes ABSOLUTELY MUST align with the shader.
If my vertices are rendering funky, this should be one of the first things I
check.
