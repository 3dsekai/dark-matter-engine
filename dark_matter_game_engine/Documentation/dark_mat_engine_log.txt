The "light flicker on rotating meshes bug" is being caused by the
'normModelMat' uniform. The below vertex normal calculation is probably incorrect:

normal = normModelMat * attrNormal; //calculate the vertex normal

So, it looks like my "light flicker" problem is being caused by my
matrix inverse algorithm churning out funky values.
Back to the drawing board...
Graphics Gems pg. 766 has a matrix inverse algo I could try using.

Finally got the matrix inverse algo working.
I scrapped the old one, and recreated it based on the
algorithm from Graphics Games.
